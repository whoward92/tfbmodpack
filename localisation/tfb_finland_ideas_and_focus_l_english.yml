 finland.10.d:0 "In 1936 Pehr Evind Svinhufvud refused seats to the Social Democrats, the largest party, in the government. As such, when elections were held in 1937, the Social Democrats attempted to gain the presidential seat. The Social Democratic candidate, Väinö Tanner, had a full third of the electors approval, but that was not enough, as Pehr Evind Svinhufvud also commanded one third. A compromise was needed, and that compromise was Kyösti Kallio, a centrist."
