As such, when elections were held in 1937, the Social Democrats attempted to gain the presidential seat. The Social Democratic candidate, Väinö Tanner, had a full third of the electors approval, but that was not enough, as Pehr Evind Svinhufvud also commanded one third. A compromise was needed, and that compromise was Kyösti Kallio, a centrist."
